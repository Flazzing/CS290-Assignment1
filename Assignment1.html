                <li>Anser:  One fact about me is that, I prefer reading about programming theory rather than practicing it. Recently, I am interested in 3D web development. I also love playing video games and my favorite game is League of Legends. I am a hard stuck Diamond 5 marksman. One of the most unique experience I ever had is traveeling to Japan. Never ever have I ever been in an society where people are so nice and honest. Additionaly, the country is fill with rich and colorful cultures. Culture such as Tea ceromony are certainly unique and a great way to study about their cultures. </li>
